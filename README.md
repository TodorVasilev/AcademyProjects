# SmartGarage

SmartGarage is a web application that enables the owners of an auto repair shop
to manage their day-to-day job. New customer walks in the shop and explains what 
the issue is with his vehicle and an employee creates a new personal vehicle in the aplication.
When the vehicle is created the employee creates a new
order that includes the newly created vehicle, as well as all the service procedures that
need to be performed (oil change, brake fluid changeâ€¦). He receives
 email, that contains information about his automatically generated login information.
 When the car is ready to pick up customer receives another automatically generated email with
 invoice, containing the total sum that he must
pay along with every service procedure that was performed on his vehicle.
